Issues that came up during the week.
====================================

Style
-----

Use PEP8 style -- really!

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

The ONLY exception is if you work in an organization that has a different style guide. It can make sense for your python code to match other code in an organization. But otherwise, use a style consistent with the rest of the Python world.

And don't use "Hungarian Notation" -- it is really non-pythonic, and sometimes actually wrong -- and a string called ``intSomething`` just adds confusion!

The best way to do this is with a linter in your editor -- like the Anaconda package in Sublime. A number of you are getting really annoyed by all the "noise" that the linter creates. But if you keep your code in PEP8 style, it won't be there!
